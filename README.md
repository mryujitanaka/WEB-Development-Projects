<!-- About The Project -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F9D0 About the Project</strong></h2>
    <p>This project is a kind of BIG folder where I keep all the "documents" related to my learning about WEB Development. It is also a time capsule where I can always go back and review some content.</p>
    <p>I believe that all knowledge on any subject should be shared with people. For that reason, I created this repository in order to be able to help the others. I hope this fulfills the purpose in some way.</p>

    <p>Some projects are exercises that you probably will not understand the context of the code. This is due to the fact that it is an exercise in a paid course.

    <p>The fact that the answer to an exercise is posted here not inflict copyright because the answers are mine or based on free information sources available on the internet.</p>

<!-- Usage Examples -->
### Usage
&#128073; Assuming you're not going to download the entire project from this repository, choose between [Udemy-Courses](https://github.com/vyujitanaka/WEB-Development-Projects/tree/main/Udemy-Courses) or [YouTube-Courses](https://github.com/vyujitanaka/WEB-Development-Projects/tree/main/YouTube-Courses) folders to access the desired project.

&#128073; GitHub is smart enough to take you straight to each project's folders. That's because it skips empty directories.

&#128073; Browse through the folders and choose one to analyze, study and/or download the project you want.

&#127881; That's it! Now test the project you have chosen on your computer and give me your feedback!
